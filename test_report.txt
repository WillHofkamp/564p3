Tests
All additional tests are included in main.cpp. They are called in the main function. The detail of these tests are described below:

test4(): empty tree test
	This test checks whether the output matches the expected output when scanning a empty B tree (i.e. relationSize = 0).

test5(): out of bound test
	This test checks whether the output matches the expected output when scanning a B tree with relationSize set to be 5000.
	This test finds keys that are not all in the range of input.

test6():  createRelationForward with large size test
	This test checks whether the output matches the expected output when scanning a B tree with a very large relationSize.
	In this test the relationSize is set to be 100000.
	We use function createRelationForward_with_size(int size) to generate B tree.
	This process might be slow. Please wait for several seconds before it finishes.

test7(): createRelationBackward with large size test
	This test checks whether the output matches the expected output when scanning a B tree with a very large relationSize.
	In this test the relationSize is set to be 100000.
	We use function createRelationBackward_with_size(int size) to generate B tree.
	This process might be slow. Please wait for several seconds before it finishes.

test8(): createRelationRandom with large size test
	This test checks whether the output matches the expected output when scanning a B tree with a very large relationSize.
	In this test the relationSize is set to be 100000.
	We use function createRelationRandom_with_size(int size) to generate B tree.
	This process might be slow. Please wait for several seconds before it finishes.

test9(): negative value test
	This test checks whether the output matches the expected output when scanning a B tree with negative values in the relation.
